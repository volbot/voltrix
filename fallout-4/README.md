# voltrix 4 Fallout 4
&emsp; The colors I chose are mostly just because I love voltrix's take on the standard RGB setup. The HUD is a soft blue, damage indicators take a pink, almost salmon-esque hue, and my favorite part, the loading-screen object highlight makes for a 'satirical but loving homage' to the standard Fallout 4 colorscheme. \
&emsp; The UI colors in Fallout 4 (and most Bethesda games) are defined by the .ini files. The proper locations for these can vary, as can the proper editing strategy, so my recommendation is to use an automated editor as described below to make these edits. The same result can be achieved with manual edits, but it's easy to mess up.
### Automated .ini Editing with [BethINI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4875)
&emsp; BethINI is pretty straightforward: Run the .exe as prescribed, select Fallout 4, and edit the colors to match the values in the screenshot below. I use Legacy BethINI through Protontricks, as the newer BethINI Pie struggles on Linux, but the same values should apply.
