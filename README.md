# voltrix
### preface
&emsp;I am very specific about what general motifs I surround myself with.\
&emsp;To this end, I have assembled a series of my synesthetic inspirations into a colorscheme; which I have entitled **「voltrix」**.\
&emsp;voltrix is a stylistic standard that invokes the whimsical uniformity of pastels, without sacrificing the vibrance of postmodernity.\
&emsp;I plan to include more specifications on more aesthetic fronts, further down the line, but I hate attaching my name to things that I don't feel are a complete deliverable, and again, I'm _very_ specific about my motifs.

## platforms
&emsp; voltrix is officially available on the following platforms.

_do that thing from resume-builder's header where it has text justified on both sides with space in the middle_

## documentation
&emsp; voltrix is disgustingly standardized, and will continue to become even more so, until you could, proverbially, describe it to a blind person.
&emsp; The standards are outlined in the [corresponding folder]().

This means that you can:
 - read the standards, to see if you like what voltrix has to offer!
 - follow the standards, to port voltrix to your favorite color-configurable application!
