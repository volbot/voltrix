# voltrix
### preface
&emsp;I am very specific about what general motifs I surround myself with.\
&emsp;To this end, I have assembled a series of my synesthetic inspirations into a colorscheme; which I have entitled **「voltrix」**.\
&emsp;voltrix is a stylistic standard that invokes the whimsical uniformity of pastels, without sacrificing the vibrance of postmodernity.\
&emsp;I plan to include more specifications on more aesthetic fronts, further down the line, but I hate attaching my name to things that I don't feel are a complete deliverable, and again, I'm _very_ specific about my motifs.

## platforms

<img align=right width=100vw src=https://www.vim.org/images/vimlogo.svg>

### Vim &emsp; ( [voltrix.vim](./vim/colors/voltrix.vim) )

- works for GUI, 256color, and 16color
- most common highlight groups targeted; see [voltrix.colortemplate](./vim/voltrix.colortemplate) for details

**WORK IN PROGRESS** - functional in every use case I've tested it for, but *does not target all highlight groups*, and *may yet have problems highlighting filetypes that I don't interact with*.\
If you run into an issue, feel free to [create an issue thread](https://gitlab.com/volbot/voltrix/-/issues/new), or get in contact with me!

### Fallout 4
&emsp; As described below, the voltrix standard is easy to follow with a little color-wheel know-how, and I've thusly applied the colorscheme to Fallout 4, replacing that garish green with a calmer, more varied palette.\
&emsp; Doing so can be complicated, so in the interest of _this_ page's brevity, I've written [a brief guide](fallout4/README.md).

## documentation
&emsp; voltrix is disgustingly standardized, and will continue to become even more so, until you could, proverbially, describe it to a blind person. The standards are outlined in the [corresponding folder](./standards/).

This means that you can:
 - read the standards, to see if you like what voltrix has to offer!
 - follow the standards, to port voltrix to your favorite color-configurable application!
