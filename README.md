### preface
&emsp; **「voltrix」** is a sweet, maximalist colorscheme that invokes the whimsical uniformity of pastels, without sacrificing the placating vibrance of postmodernity.

## documentation
&emsp; voltrix is disgustingly standardized, and will continue to become even more so, until you could, proverbially, describe it to a blind person. The standards are outlined in the [corresponding folder](./standards/).

This means that you can:
 - read the standards, to see if you like what voltrix has to offer!
 - follow the standards, to port voltrix to your favorite color-configurable application!
