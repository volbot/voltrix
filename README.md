# VOLTRIX
### preface
&emsp; **「VOLTRIX」** is a sweet, maximalist colorscheme that invokes the whimsical uniformity of pastels, without sacrificing the placating vibrance of postmodernity.

### Fallout 4
&emsp; As described below, the VOLTRIX standard is easy to follow with a little color-wheel know-how, and I've thusly applied the colorscheme to Fallout 4, replacing that garish green with a calmer, more varied palette.\
&emsp; Doing so can be complicated, so in the interest of _this_ page's brevity, I've written [a brief guide](fallout4/README.md).

## documentation
&emsp; VOLTRIX is disgustingly standardized, and will continue to become even more so, until you could, proverbially, describe it to a blind person. The standards are outlined in the [corresponding folder](./standards/).

This means that you can:
 - read the standards, to see if you like what VOLTRIX has to offer!
 - follow the standards, to port VOLTRIX to your favorite color-configurable application!
