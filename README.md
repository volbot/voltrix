# voltrix ; a colorscheme for X11 applications
### preface
&emsp;I am very specific about what general motifs I surround myself with.
&emsp;To this end, I have assembled a series of my synesthetic inspirations into a colorscheme; which I have entitled `「voltrix」`.
&emsp;I plan to include more specifications on more aesthetic fronts, further down the line, but I hate attaching my name to things that I don't feel are a complete deliverable, and again, I'm _very_ specific about my motifs.
